Full control over your WordPress REST API. Block, restrict, or whitelist endpoints per user role. Lightweight, fast, zero frontend footprint.

== Description ==

**MaxtDesign REST API Control** gives you complete control over who can access your WordPress REST API and which endpoints are available.

By default, WordPress exposes a REST API to the public, which can reveal usernames, post data, and site structure to anyone. This plugin lets you lock down the REST API for unauthenticated visitors while keeping it fully functional for logged-in users and the plugins that need it.

= Key Features =

* **One-click disable** — Block all REST API access for unauthenticated users with a single toggle.
* **Endpoint whitelisting** — Auto-discovers all registered REST API endpoints and lets you whitelist specific ones, even when the API is disabled.
* **Per-role access control** — Restrict REST API access for specific user roles with individual endpoint whitelists.
* **Smart defaults** — Automatically detects Contact Form 7 and WooCommerce and whitelists their required endpoints on activation.
* **Zero frontend footprint** — No CSS, JavaScript, or HTTP requests are added to your frontend. Ever.
* **Lightweight** — No database queries on frontend requests. Uses a single autoloaded option.
* **Import/Export** — Transfer settings between sites with JSON export and import.
* **Clean uninstall** — Removes all plugin data when deleted. Leaves no trace.

= How It Works =

The plugin uses the `rest_authentication_errors` filter — the correct, modern WordPress approach — to intercept REST API requests early in the lifecycle, before any endpoint logic executes. This means blocked requests have virtually zero performance impact.

= Built for Performance =

This plugin follows the MaxtDesign performance-first philosophy:

* Zero frontend asset loading (no CSS, no JS, no HTTP requests)
* Admin assets load only on the plugin's own settings page
* Single autoloaded database option — no extra queries
* Filter fires before endpoint logic — blocked requests are fast

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `maxtdesign-rest-api-control` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **Settings > REST API Control** to configure.
4. The REST API is blocked for unauthenticated users by default. Adjust the whitelist as needed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this break my site? =

No. The plugin only affects REST API requests. Your website's frontend, admin dashboard, and all standard WordPress functionality remain completely unaffected. Logged-in users have full REST API access by default.

= Does this work with Contact Form 7? =

Yes. Contact Form 7 requires the REST API for form submissions. The plugin automatically detects CF7 on activation and whitelists its endpoints. If you activate CF7 after this plugin, simply check the `contact-form-7` namespace in the endpoint whitelist.

= Does this work with WooCommerce? =

Yes. The plugin automatically detects WooCommerce on activation and whitelists the Store API endpoints (`wc/store`) needed for cart and checkout blocks. The WooCommerce admin API endpoints are available to logged-in users by default.

= What happens when I deactivate the plugin? =

Your REST API returns to normal WordPress behavior — fully open. Your settings are preserved so they'll be restored if you reactivate. Settings are only deleted when you **delete** the plugin through the WordPress admin.

= Does this affect the WordPress block editor (Gutenberg)? =

No. By default the plugin only restricts **unauthenticated** requests, and every logged-in user keeps full REST API access — so the block editor, which talks to the REST API as the logged-in author, is completely unaffected. The "Allow REST API for all logged-in users" toggle is on out of the box specifically to keep the editor, dashboard, and admin AJAX working. You would only see editor issues if you deliberately turn that toggle off **and** restrict your own role without whitelisting `wp/v2` — which the per-role UI makes explicit.

= Can I restrict specific user roles? =

Yes. The Per-Role Controls section lets you restrict REST API access for individual roles (subscriber, contributor, author, editor, etc.) and configure a custom endpoint whitelist for each restricted role.

= What happens if a user has more than one role? =

The most permissive role wins. If a user holds any role that is **not** restricted, they keep full REST API access. If every one of their roles is restricted, the plugin combines the whitelists of all those roles and allows a request that any of them permits. This prevents a single restricted role (for example a stray `subscriber` capability) from unexpectedly locking out a user who also has an unrestricted role.

= Does this work with custom REST API endpoints? =

Yes. The plugin auto-discovers all registered REST API endpoints, including those from themes and other plugins. Any custom endpoints will appear in the whitelist tree.

= How do I transfer settings to another site? =

Use the Export Settings button to download a JSON file, then use Import Settings on the other site to upload it.

== Screenshots ==

1. Global settings — one-click toggle to disable REST API for unauthenticated users.
2. Endpoint whitelist — auto-discovered endpoints with collapsible namespace tree.
3. Per-role controls — restrict REST API access for individual user roles.
4. Import/Export — easily transfer settings between sites.

== Privacy ==

This plugin makes no external HTTP requests, sets no cookies, loads no third-party scripts, and collects no analytics. It does not track usage and never "calls home." It stores a single settings option (`mdra_settings`) in your database and nothing else; that option is removed when you delete the plugin. No personal or visitor data is processed or transmitted.

== Security ==

Found a security issue? Please report it privately to security@maxtdesign.com rather than posting
in a public support thread. We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days and will agree a
disclosure timeline with you.

Please include the plugin version, steps to reproduce, and the impact as you understand it. We will
credit you in the changelog unless you would rather stay anonymous, and we ask that you do not test
against a site you do not own.

This plugin is published on WordPress.org by the account `slaacr`, which is MaxtDesign. The account
name predates the brand and WordPress.org does not support renaming accounts, so the two names
differ. Anything published under `slaacr` is ours.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.6 =
* New: published security contact and vulnerability disclosure policy. Security issues now have a private reporting route (security@maxtdesign.com) instead of a public support thread, with a 3 business day acknowledgement target.
* New: documented that the WordPress.org account `slaacr` is MaxtDesign, so it is clear who publishes this plugin.
* Declared compatibility with WordPress 7.1.
* No functional changes.

= 1.0.5 =
* Internationalization: the text domain now matches the plugin slug (`maxtdesign-rest-api-control`) so the plugin can be translated through the WordPress.org translation system. No functional change.

= 1.0.4 =
* Renamed the plugin to **MaxtDesign REST API Control** to better reflect what it does — whitelist and per-role control, not just an on/off switch. The in-product menu and settings page were already named "REST API Control"; this aligns the plugin's public name with them. No settings, hooks, or behaviour changed.

= 1.0.3 =
* Fix: route-level whitelisting now works for parameterized endpoints. Checking an individual route such as `wp/v2/posts/(?P<id>[\d]+)` previously stored a corrupted value (the sanitiser mangled the regex) and could never match a real request. Route patterns are now stored intact and matched the way WordPress itself matches them. Namespace-level whitelisting was unaffected.
* Improve: multi-role users now get the most permissive result. Any unrestricted role grants full access; if every role is restricted, their whitelists are combined. Previously the first restricted role found could lock out a user who also held an unrestricted role.
* Fix: the "requires REST API access" compatibility warnings now appear on every visit to the settings page, not only immediately after saving.
* Improve: smart defaults are now seeded per-site on multisite — both on network-wide activation and for sites created later.
* Improve: the custom error message now stores empty as "use the default," so the blocked-request message always follows the site's current language instead of freezing whichever locale was active when it was saved.
* Performance: the settings page no longer instantiates its admin UI on front-end or REST requests, and discovers the REST route table only once per page load.
* Housekeeping: removed an unused internal placeholder class and tidied redundant nonce-check branches.

= 1.0.2 =
* Fix: the REST API root index (`/wp-json/`) is now blocked when "Disable REST API for unauthenticated users" is on. Previously, the controller's route-lookup returned an empty string for the root index and the code took an early fail-open branch — meaning the most-scraped discovery URL was always exposed even when the plugin was active. Logged-out visitors and unauthenticated scrapers now hit the configured error response on `/wp-json/` like any other endpoint.

= 1.0.1 =
* Compatibility: confirmed against WordPress 7.0 ("Armstrong").
* Hardening: import-settings now validates uploads with `is_uploaded_file()` and reads the temp file directly instead of mis-sanitising the server-generated path.
* Hardening: activation hook defensively loads `wp-admin/includes/plugin.php` before calling `is_plugin_active()` so WP-CLI and multisite bulk-activate paths can't fatal.
* Fix: the "this plugin requires REST API access" compatibility notice no longer fires for plugins whose namespaces aren't actually registered on the site (e.g. WooCommerce installed but Store API blocks not loaded).
* Cleanup: removed the now-unnecessary `load_plugin_textdomain()` call. WordPress.org handles translation loading automatically since WP 4.6, and the just-in-time loader added in 6.7 made the explicit call dead code.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.
* Global REST API toggle for unauthenticated users.
* Auto-discovery of all registered REST API endpoints.
* Endpoint whitelisting with collapsible namespace tree.
* Per-role REST API access controls.
* Smart defaults for Contact Form 7 and WooCommerce.
* Custom error message for blocked requests.
* Settings import/export as JSON.
* Clean uninstall — removes all plugin data.

== Upgrade Notice ==
